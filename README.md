Problem 1 from the book System Verification for testbench by Chris Spear ● Greg Tumbush
Write a verifi cation plan for an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with:
• Asynchronous active high input reset 
• Input clock 
• 4-bit signed inputs, A and B 
• 5-bit signed output C that is registered on the positive edge of input clock. 
• 4 opcodes
– Add: A + B 
– Sub: A − B 
– Bit-wise invert: A 
– Reduction Or: B
